This region comprises mainly hills, mountains, hollows and plains and extends along the Tiber’s central basin.&nbsp;<br>At the heart of the boot, it is the only region with no coastline. <br><br>It includes&nbsp;Lake Trasimeno, central Italy’s largest lake. The area still has the remains of Etruscan settlements, particularly around&nbsp;Castiglione del Lago, where the loveliness of the natural landscape combines with the romanticism and stillness of the lake. <br>Moving on from the two lakes, we come to the&nbsp;Cascate delle Marmore&nbsp;waterfalls near&nbsp;Terni, some of the most beautiful in Europe. <br>The waters dive into the River Nera with a spectacular 165 m&nbsp;(541 ft)&nbsp;drop, and are surrounded by lush vegetation. This is the spot for&nbsp;sports lovers who enjoy canoeing, kayaking, and not only.&nbsp;<br><br>Still in the province of Terni, tourists looking to get the feel of Umbria should not miss out on two little gems: one of them is linked to history and the other to the territory.&nbsp;Carsulae&nbsp;is an ancient Roman town traversed by the ancient Via Flaminia, where important public buildings have been discovered. We can still see the remains of the&nbsp;S. Damiano Arch, with particularly beautiful and fascinating surroundings. <br>The other gem, closely linked to the area’s makeup is the Dunarobba Fossil Forest, a rare example of a forest that existed 3 million years ago, with very well-preserved tree trunks set in a lunar landscape.&nbsp;<br><br>The provinces of the region are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/umbria/perugia.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">Perugia</a>&nbsp;(regional capital) and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.italia.it/en/discover-italy/umbria/terni.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">Terni</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>

Gubbio not only attracts visitors with its art, but also&nbsp;with its&nbsp;spectacular traditional festivals&nbsp;like the&nbsp;Corsa dei Ceri&nbsp;(Candle Race) and the&nbsp;Palio Balestra&nbsp;(a Medieval crossbow contest on horseback).&nbsp;The former takes place&nbsp;in honor of the Patron Saint,&nbsp;the latter in memory of its ancient past. Another of the countless charming Umbrian cities&nbsp;is&nbsp;Orvieto, with its famous&nbsp;Duomo, one of the masterpieces of Italian Gothic art, and&nbsp;St. Patrick’s Well, a 62-meter-deep (203 feet)&nbsp;feat of engineering characterized by two spiral staircases that wind around the well (yet never meet), with 248 steps down to the water.&nbsp;<br><br>Then&nbsp;Spoleto, a picturesque town that boasts a thousand-year-old history, still preserves images from the past in its Medieval and Renaissance architecture.&nbsp;<br>Its stone lanes and its most famous monuments are the setting for international cultural events, such as the&nbsp;Festival of the Two Worlds, a wonderful occasion for enjoying&nbsp;a high-quality artistic atmosphere.&nbsp;<br><br>Between art and spirituality, a visit to the Medieval town of&nbsp;<a href="en/discover-italy/umbria/poi/assisi.html" class="internal-link">Assisi</a>&nbsp;is essential; a&nbsp;<a href="en/travel-ideas/unesco-world-heritage-sites/assisi-and-the-basilica-of-st-francis.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>,its&nbsp; represents “a series of masterpieces of man‘s creative spirit.” Everything revolves around its most renowned citizen,&nbsp;St. Francis, Patron Saint of Italy: from the&nbsp;Basilica, which is dedicated to the Saint and contains his tomb, to the&nbsp;hermitage&nbsp;(Eremo delle Carceri), a few kilometers outside the town walls, where St. Francis used to retreat in prayer.&nbsp;<br>Assisi&nbsp;is very welcoming and lively, and its inhabitants seem to want to share their age-old traditions with visitors;&nbsp;Calendimaggio, for instance, is a splendid historical commemoration that turns Assisi into an old Medieval town inhabited by knights and ladies, bowmen and standard-bearers that belong to a distant, far-off&nbsp;past.&nbsp;<br><a href="en/travel-ideas/art-cities/perugia.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">Perugia</a>, Umbria’s main city dates back to Antiquity and is composed of&nbsp;a higher section on the hill, whence&nbsp;the Medieval villages spread out on its slopes.

With its vibrant cultural center, two universities and internationally-influential expos, Perugia is a great draw for tourists that also offers a cosmopolitan atmosphere.&nbsp;</p></div>
